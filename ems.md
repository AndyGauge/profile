## Project Plan for Grand AM EMS replacement

### Harness

#### Sensors
1. Cam position sensor 1X for Cylinder 1
2. Crank position sensor 24X
3. MAP - manifold absolute pressure
4. IAT - Intake temperature
5. TPS - Throttle position
6. EGO - O2 sensor 
7. CHT - coolant temperature

#### Output
1. Injectors - I have 6 injectors and the harness is configured so that all the grounds are a shared wire, Fred says 3 pairs.  Need to determine how to put square hole in round peg here
2. Ignition advance - Ask Andy about the GM DIS, I think there are 2 connectors
3. XGT - x gate for exhaust

#### Fit for Future
1. MAF - required to calculate load, mpg, etc
2. Boost - extra pair for electric supercharger control
3. IAC - Idle air control, sounds like the only new feature that I stand a chance at working on at first
4. 4 aux wires using protype usb compatible protocol

#### Notes
* spec for coolant temperature and injector harness should follow GM adapter at left of engine bay
* GM fit adapters for harness
* custom fit for adaptible jumpers to PCB, hard drive ribbon?

#### Dimensions
* TODO: Number of wires, harnesses
* Distance from inside firewall to con1
* Distance from outside firewall to split1

## New Gm harness from junkyard.
* labeling sensors
* tracing wires
* determine printouts for 3 or more wires
* injector sub connector has map injectors cht 
* maf labeled
