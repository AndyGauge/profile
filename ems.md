## Project Plan for Grand AM EMS replacement

### Harness

#### Sensors
1. Cam position sensor 1X for Cylinder 1
2. Crank position sensor 24X
3. MAP - manifold absolute pressure
4. IAT - Intake temperature
5. TPS - Throttle position
6. EGO - O2 sensor 
7. CHT - coolant temperature

#### Output
1. Injectors - I have 6 injectors and the harness is configured so that all the grounds are a shared wire, Fred says 3 pairs.  Need to determine how to put square hole in round peg here
2. Ignition advance - Ask Andy about the GM DIS, I think there are 2 connectors
3. XGT - x gate for exhaust

#### Fit for Future
1. MAF - required to calculate load, mpg, etc
2. Boost - extra pair for electric supercharger control
3. IAC - Idle air control, sounds like the only new feature that I stand a chance at working on at first
4. 4 aux wires using protype usb compatible protocol

#### Notes
* spec for coolant temperature and injector harness should follow GM adapter at left of engine bay
* GM fit adapters for harness
* custom fit for adaptible jumpers to PCB, hard drive ribbon?

#### Dimensions
* TODO: Number of wires, harnesses
* Distance from inside firewall to con1
* Distance from outside firewall to split1

## Next actions

I'm going to the junkyard tomorrow and browsing the many 3400s they have in stock in the rainy North West where these things stock pile over the winter season.  I've already started pulling apart the 2004 that I replaced my injector harness.  It will be tough to pass up the leather seats since they are like $100 for the pair
